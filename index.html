    <h1>DO YOU KNOW?</h1>

    <p> As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, safe and effective vaccines were developed and produced quickly.<img class="image1-right" src="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/07/shutterstock_1971202682-scaled.jpg"></img><br>Vast majority of it were administered in high-income countries.
        According to the United Nations Development Program, 1 in 10 people have received at least one dose in low- to middle-income countries in contrast to high income countries' 1 to 1 ratio.<br>
    </p>

    <p>In other words, the virus is moving faster than the global distribution of vaccines.<br>This leaves the low- to middle-income countries vulnerable to the virus and its mutations.<br></p>

    <p>The World Health Organization says there are enough vaccine doses to be distributed globally. However, to cover the cost of vaccinating 70% of the population, low-income countries have to increase their health care spending by 56.6%
        whereas high-income countries needed only to increase it by 0.8%.<br></p>
