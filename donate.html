    <p><h3>Why We Need COVAX</h3>
         Developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is the most pressing challenge of our time - and nobody wins the race until everyone wins.
         The global pandemic has already caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and disrupted the lives of billions more. As well as reducing the tragic loss of life and helping to get the pandemic under control, introduction of a vaccine will prevent the loss of US$ 375 billion to the global economy every month. Global equitable access to a vaccine, particularly protecting health care workers and those most-at-risk is the only way to mitigate the public health and economic impact of the pandemic.</p>
